# Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor

32-bit MIPS processor implemented in Verilog code

The Architecture was tested via compiled files from  **asm_execution directory**

Pay attention that before simulation run is necessory to specify instruction number like **@0 @4 @8..** corresponding to PC counting 

Is possibe to use custom compiled binaries but only in **Compact, Data at Address 0** memory mode

Run selected testbench via **vsim -do sim.do** (Modelsim simulator)
